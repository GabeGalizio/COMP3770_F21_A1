4. Hit play ;) (per group memeber)
5. Explain each primitive object in a document called "Explanations.docx" and put it in your project folder (Done by: )
	why it behaved the way it did
	why it move
	why it didn't move
	what did you add or remove from the object that made is behave how it did

	h. teal (0,128,128,128) *transparent* (Done by: A Little Gingus) (NOTE: for the transparent the shader must support the aplpha channel (not the default opaque shader))
	i. white (255,255,255,255) (Done by: Mingus^-1)
	j. yellow (0,0,255,255) (Done by: Giagnus)

 3. Make a blue cube named "Blue Cube" and set its position to (-3,1-3) (Done by: You Guessed It, Gingus)
 4. Make a red sphere named "Red Sphere 1" and set its position to (-2.5,1,0) w/ rigidbody that uses gravity and is not kinematic 
    (Done by: I Can't Believe It's Not Gingus)
 5. Make a red sphere named "Red Sphere 2" and set its position to (-1.5,1,0) w/o rigidbody (Done by: Oops I Gingus Again)
 6. Make a green capsule named "Green Capsule" and set its position to (-3,2,3) w/ rigidbody that is not kinematic and uses gravity 
    set the scale to (2,2,2) (Done by: Gingus, Taker of the Green Pill (or capsule ig))
 7. Make a yellow cylinder named "Yellow Cylinder" and set its position to (0,1,-3) (Done by: Gingus No. 5)
 8. Make an orange sphere named "Orange Sphere" and set its position to (0,1,0) w/ kinematic rigidbody that uses gravity (Done by: Gingus 2 Electric Boogaloo)
 9. Make a purple cube named "Purple Cube" and set its position to (0,1,3) w/ rotation (45,45,45) (Done by: Gingus Is Running Out of Funny Name Ideas)
10. Make a white sphere named "White Sphere 1" and set its potition to (1.5,1,0) w/ kinematic rigidbody 
    that does not use gravity (Done by: Featuring Gingus from the Devil May Cry Series)
11. Make a white sphere named "White Sphere 2" and set its position to(2.5,1,0) w/ rigidbody that uses gravity and 
    not kinematic (Done by: Your Friendly Neighbourhood Gingus)
12. Make a grey sphere named "Grey Sphere" and set its position to (3,4,-3) w/ rigidbody that uses gravity and not
    kinematic (Done by: There is a Gingus Amingus)
13. Make a black shpere named "Black Sphere" and set its positon to (3,4,3) w/ rigidbody that uses gravity, 
    not kinematic with the collider removed (Done by: The little Gingus that lives in your walls.)
14. Make a yellow cube named "Yellow Cube" and set its position to (5.5,0,0) w/o rigidbody (Done by: The big Gingus up in the sky)
15. Make a black cube named "Black Cube" and st its position to (4,1,0) w/ rotaion of (0,0,45) and scale of (0.5,1,2), 
    rigidbody that does not used gravity and not kinematic (Done by: A Gingus that nobody knows.)

Scritps
1. Make a folder called scripts (Done by: )
2. To the orange sphere add a script called "MoveIt" that makes it move repeatedly between (3,1,0) and (-3,1,0) (Done by: )
   moving at 1 unit/s starting to move in the positive direction initially, 
   it should move from its intial position of (0,1,0) to (3,1,0) (Done by: )
3. To the yellow cube add a script called "RotateIt" that makes the cube rotate (30,60,90) /s (Done by: )
4. To the purple cube add a script called "ResizeIt" that scales it up to 4x its orgianal size the back down to its original size
   @ 1unit/s repeatedly.  (Done by: )
